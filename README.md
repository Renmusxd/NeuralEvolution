A neural node evolution simulator.

Welcome to NeuralEvolution!

This is a simple evolution simulator based around the evolution of three main sets of characteristics:

* Thought Process - made out of Neural Nodes which connected inputs and outputs through logical functions
* Body Structure - optimize processes and metabolism while defending the body
* Traits - affect characteristics of the creature and its effects on others
